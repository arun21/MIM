# MIM

MIM stands for **M**obile **I**nventory **M**anager.

This project originally came from [natsumiaya][natsumiaya]. It got stuck in the past (middle 2015). Now, I am ([meisyal][meisyal]) eager to continue this project.

## Status

Currently, this project is under development. There are still many requirements that have not been finished yet. Documentation is not available for now.
